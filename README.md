# node-red-contrib-hx711-optimized
A simple <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node to get the weight value from a hx711 attached to the Raspberry Pis GPIOs.<br>
Forked from <a href="https://github.com/rtoenniges/node-red-contrib-hx711" target="_new">rtoenniges/node-red-contrib-hx711</a>, but uses <a href="https://github.com/ataberkylmz/hx711" target="_new">@ataberkylmz's hx711</a> package which is optimized for reduced CPU usage.
